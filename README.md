# Warmup-Exercise- Team 6: Databaes

## Our Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Sentiment Rating Widget WebApp developed by Team 6: Databaes! Our team consists of 11 dedicated members who collaborated to create a user-friendly and efficient sentiment rating widget using HTML, JS, and CSS. Below, we'll walk you through our planning process, brainstorming sessions, the ideation phase, and finally, our widget's features and functionality.

### Planning the Project:

Before diving into development, our team conducted several meetings to outline the project scope, set goals, and allocate responsibilities. We defined our target audience, which included website owners, bloggers, and content creators looking to gather feedback on their content's sentiment.

### Brainstorming and Ideation Phase:

During the brainstorming phase, we explored various ideas for the sentiment rating widget's design and functionality. We considered different methods for collecting user feedback, such as star ratings, emoji reactions, and text input. After evaluating the pros and cons of each approach, we decided to create a simple yet effective dinosaur-themed sentiment rating system. This included getting the user's sentiment using 5 diffferent dinosaur expressions, and then allowing them to rate the service from a rating of 1 egg to 5 eggs (analogous to stars). 

This ideation process involved a lot of throwing around ideas, thinking of different ways we can gauge a user's sentiment (emojis, a meter to rate their satisfaction, the "star" rating system, and so on). At the end, our team settled on using an animal-themed based rating system to make it unique and a memorable user experience and came up with 2 choices- a dinosaur and an otter. We voted upon this and came to the dino conclusion.

We made sure not just to come up with the idea, but hash out the exact details- what will the page look like, who will wokr on what component, how can we divide up the work to make sure everyone gets an equal part, can we do a SWOT analysis on our work, and so on. All in all, the ideation process pushed us to work together as a team and come up with a unique and fun widget.

### Widget Features:

Our sentiment rating widget allows users to express their sentiment towards content by selecting one of dinosaur expressions. The widget provides a visually appealing and intuitive way for users to provide feedback, which can be valuable for content creators to gauge audience reactions. The user can also choose to not give feedback/rating and that just redirects them to the Thank You page. If they do give feedback, it redirects them to the Thank You page and displays their feedback to us.

### Development Process:

The development process involved creating the frontend interface using HTML and CSS, and implementing the functionality with JavaScript. We made sure to make the page easy-to-navigate for people who find it difficult to use technology and also simple to use for people with disabilities. Moreover, it is compatible on various sized devices and has simple features such as the minimalist color pastel, contrasting colors for easy readibility, big clear buttons and simple to raed text, visually appealing features to engage our users (dinosaur eggs popping to show baby dinosaurs), and just a great user experience for a simple widget.

We also made sure to use good GitHub practices by using branches for developing different features, making use of labels and assignees, making PRs after significant progress and merging it with main after resolving any merge conflicts if needed.
